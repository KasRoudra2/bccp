# BanglishCPP

### Write CPP in Banglish. It's fun!

#### Command

```
bash bccp.sh <filename>
```
Ex: `bash bccp.sh test.bcpp`

If you've copied the bccp function to `bash.bashrc` you can simply use `bccp <filename>`

#### Instruction

1. Each statement must end with semicolon
2. Use `songkha` to declare int
3. Use `jodi`, `othoba`, `nahole` for `if`, `else if`, `else`
4. Use `dekhai` to show output
5. Uss `nei` to store input value in a variable
6. Use `beshi`, `kom`, `soman` as conditional operators

##### Fun fact
This is entirely CPP based, so you can always write pure CPP codes in bccp file
